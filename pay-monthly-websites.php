         <p>No site builders here. You tell us what you want, and we design the site using the most up to date design and development techniques. No templates. No limiting do-it-yourself website builders and best of all a great price! We build your website. You build your business.</p>
         <p>All our Pay Monthly Websites are fully managed, this means that support is included in your monthly payment. If there’s anything you can’t do (or don’t want to!) you have a team of developers at the end of the phone or email, ready to work on your site for no extra cost! Struggling with formatting images? Don’t know how to implement a video into your site? Want to change the way the menu works? You don’t have to waste time trying to figure it out, just put in a change request through your personal Client Area.</p>
