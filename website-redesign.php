         <p>After having an outdated templated website that was built by someone else, Busy Bees enlisted our services to re-design a modern clean 1 page website to act as an information page. As the nursery has no one technical they signed up to our Simple Package to ensure that their entire online presence was looked after professionally and any changes are made promptly and to the best standards. For a simple 1 page site, it has a great impact and demonstrates that sometimes clean and simple can be very striking.</p>
         <h3>Sound Sense</h3>
         <p>Sound Sense came to us with a very dated looking website which was designed nearly a decade ago! Offering marketing services to their clients, they needed a clean looking uptodate website redesign that would win them clients rather than turn them away! Expanding into a European market we migrated the site to a .eu domain to make it clear that Sound Sense delivered marketing services across the continent.</p>
         <h3>True Revenue Management After</h3>
         <p>We worked with PMP on the re-launch of our website. We wanted the site to be more engaging and interesting. PMP were a pleasure to deal with, very flexible and creative in their solutions. Their customer service was excellent and nothing was too much trouble and most importantly we are delighted with our new website. Kate Bentley </p>
         <h3>Edenvale</h3>
         <p>    We were looking for a company to overhaul the look and feel of our existing website edenvale-uk.com. Unfortunately we were struggling finding a company who understood what we needed while keeping the work within budget. Push My Profile were recommended to us and they sent through a mock-up which really hit the nail on the head. We are delighted with the new design and are really happy with the quality of the work.
